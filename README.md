# Guessing-number

Program inputs values from the user untill it matches with the random number from 1 to 100 

packages used : random

# works

A random number is generated and stored in a variable using the random.randint(1, 100) method.

The program enters an infinite while True loop to continuously ask for the user's guess.

User input is taken using the input() function and stored as an integer in a variable.

An if-elif-else block checks the user's guess against the random number:

If the guess is correct, a success message is printed, and the break statement exits the loop, ending the program.

If the guess is too low or too high, a hint is printed, and the loop continues.
